            <p>Korea is a pretty affordable destination for food, skincare, and clothes. You’ll probably spend a lot of money. If you have the time, learn to read Hangul and learn the names of common Korean dishes because many smaller, local eateries don’t have menus in English. It’s not impossible to get by without doing this, but it would’ve made our lives easier. Hangul isn’t difficult to learn. As a backup, Google Translate might be able to help you.</p>
            <p>Honestly, I never thought Korea would be a place of interest for me. Not for any particular reason, but it’s just a destination that didn’t cross my mind despite my short, obsessive K-POP phase. Growing up, I wasn’t exposed to too much Korean culture besides Koren BBQ, tofu houses serving soondubu jjigae, and stereotypes that Koreans are angry and mean. Even Korean skincare things like face masks weren’t really on my radar until they got really popular in America. I will say that thanks to K-POP and my Korean/Korea-loving friends, I developed more of an interest in their culture in the recent years. Read on if you want to hear about my tips and recommendations for Korea!</p>

            <h5>Weather</h5>
            <p>Korea in autumn (late October) is probably closer to winter in Southern California. I was not prepared. Bring more jackets than I did, or pick on up along the way. I’d say a raincoat and umbrella is handy to have because some days had random spots of rain. When rain snuck up on us, street vendors selling umbrellas for 5000won a piece popped up out of nowhere and saved us. You also do plenty of walking in Korea, so bring comfortable shoes that can ideally take a bit of wetness.</p>
            <h5>Transportation</h5>
            <p>Before everything, get your hands on a <a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/TRP/TP_ENG_8_1_1.jsp">T-Money card</a>, which is Korea’s version of a bus/train card. The card itself costs 4000won. You can buy from card vending machines at major train stations and most convenience stores (CU, 7-11, emart, GS25). The cards can be loaded with money to save you time on public transit, and can even give you discounts for transfer rides. We mainly got around using a combination of buses and subway. We booked a ticket in advance online to take the <a href="http://info.korail.com/mbs/english/index.jsp">Korail train</a> from Busan Station to Seoul Station.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/05_tmoney.JPG" alt="TMoney card">
            <p>Download the Naver Map app as it’s more accurate and informative in Korea than Google Maps. The app is in English and has information on bus times and whatnot. My friend in Korea also recommended Kakao Maps.</p>

            <p>Korean cuisine (traditionally) is heavy in carbs, moderate in protein, and lower in fat. Most meals are served with banchan, or side dishes, made of fresh vegetables. Broths and soups are often anchovy, kombu, or meat based. Spicy food is made spicy using Korean red pepper paste, red pepper flakes, and a variety of chilli peppers. There’s a lot of fermented food in Korean culture like kimchi, cucumbers, and soybean paste.</p>
            <p>So… I don’t actually know the name of many of the food places we went to because the names were usually in Korean. Instead, I’ll recommend some dishes you should try while you’re in Korea that’s not KBBQ. You can check reviews and pictures on Naver Map and sometimes on Google Maps. I’ve found the quality to be quite good in the places we visited.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Kimbap:</b> Korean version of sushi. They often contain colorful veggies, a protein, and rice all wrapped in a sheet of seaweed and brushed with sesame oil. There’s plenty of mom & pop eateries everywhere, including around universities, that sell these rolls for less than 4000won a roll depending on the place and fillings. These also taste great dipped in tteokbokki sauce.</li>
              <li><b>Tteokbokki:</b> How do I describe this? It’s essentially cylindrical shaped rice cakes in a spicy sauce. It’s usually served with fishcake, green onion, boiled eggs, and sometimes ramen noodles and hot dogs. It’s a filling, inexpensive comfort dish.</li>
              <li><b>Kalguksoo:</b> A warming bowl of noodles, soup, and veggies that’s a more traditional Korean dish. The broth is a clear broth usually made with a base of anchovies and kombu. The noodles are a mid-width and made of wheat flour. The restaurant we went to in Busan sold a huge bowl for 4000won. Super worth and filling.</li>
              <li><b>Korean Fried Chicken:</b> I didn’t partake in this, but Warren did. His verdict is that the quality of Korean chicken is superior to that of America. He ate a whole plate of crispy fried chicken on his own. This is a hip thing now, so you can probably find fried chicken stores easily in Seoul. It’s usually served with shredded cabbage salad and crispy, pickled radishes. You should also order some beer to avoid weird looks.</li>
              <li><b>Bingsoo (Korean Shaved Ice):</b> I recommend a chain called Sul Bing, which is identical to it’s ripped off counterpart in America, Sul & Beans. Korean shaved ice is finally shredded milk-infused ice. Traditional toppings are injeolmi (sweet soybean powder), mochi, and red beans. More trendy flavors include matcha, seasonal fruits, Oreo, coffee, etc. You also get a nice little cup of condensed milk to drizzle or douse you’re icy treat in.</li>
              <li><b>Bibimbap:</b> Rice, veggies, and a protein (often bulgogi) served in a stone pot. You’ve probably seen this in Korean restaurants but they’re easy to find and a tasty option. I had a clam bibimbap and really enjoyed the freshness of it! Usually, they are served with a soup and side dishes like kimchi and pickled radish.</li>

              </div>
              <li><b>Army Base Stew:</b> This is a popular dish, especially in university areas. It’s almost like a cross between tteokbokki and tofu stew. It’s a pot of spicy broth containing sausage, instant ramen noodles, meat, rice cakes, green onions, and oftentimes topped with a square of American cheese. It’s not a healthy dish by any means. The place our friend took us to (near Korea University) served it with a side of tator tots and rice.</li>
              <li><b>Heotteok:</b> A street pancake filled with either brown sugar or red bean paste. These are often made fresh on a grill. I say pancake, but the skin is more chewy than that, closer to the texture of a Taiwanese scallion pancake.</li>
              <li><b>Korean Dumplings (Mandoo):</b> I mean dumplings are dumplings, but mandoo can come in huge sizes! They’re often ordered in companion to another dish, like bibimguksoo (spicy mixed noodles).</li>
              <li><b>Persimmons:</b> If you happen to be in Korea around autumn or winter, you can find tasty persimmons sold by fruit & veggie vendors on the street. I bought a basket of cute, ripe fuyu persimmons for 3000won. I was in heaven.</li>
              <li><b>Korean Pancakes:</b> Often sold at bars as a companion to alcohol, Korean pancakes are crispy pancakes made using a variety of vegetables and meat. It’s a little like okonomiyaki crossed with scallion pancakes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Busan</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/05_street.JPG" alt="Gukeje Market">
            <p>Our first stop in Korea was the lovely city of Busan! My friend warned me that Busan locals were more harsh and rude, but in our experience, they were very helpful to us lost lambs. Locals here do have an accent that makes them sound more “angry” however, we received help without asking on two instances when were lost on public transit. Once, an auntie legit took my hand and pulled me to the right subway platform. Another time, a kind gentleman on the bus used his miming skills and limited English to direct us to a more efficient bus route to Gamcheon. I did enjoy the slower vibes of Busan, and I would love to return (:</p>
            <h5>Accomodation</h5>
            <p>We booked this <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11428750?s=67&shared_item_type=1&virality_entry_point=1&sharer_id=100362167">Airbnb</a>. It was an entire studio room, that was a good size and had a kitchen and washing machine. Though we never met our host, he left plenty of guides and recommendations for food and ways to get to popular sightseeing places in Busan. He was very responsive and kind over messaging. My partner’s only gripe about this place was that the windows weren’t properly sealed so mosquitos ended up getting in and biting him. I don’t imagine that this would pose a problem in the colder months, though. Both beds in the room had an electrically heated mat and it blew our minds. After this trip, Warren got an electric blanket.</p>
            <p>The rest of the nights we stayed at Airbnbs (<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/50085473">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7076299?s=67&shared_item_type=1&virality_entry_point=1&sharer_id=100362167">2018</a>). Many apartments in Tokyo are small studios due to the crowdedness of the city. Just be prepared for that if you do decide to go for a private apartment over a rented room.</p>
            <h5>Fun Places</h5><div class="clearfix">
            <ul>
              <li><b>Gamcheon Culture Village:</b> Super cute place to walk around with colorful buildings and winding streets. This was originally a town built by Korean War Refugees in the 1950s and has more recently been restored to function as a tourist attraction. We went on a particular rainy day but I still found the buildings charming. There’s plenty of food and snack stands around to munch on throughout your stroll. We tried a raindrop cake with mango syrup and soybean powder.</li>
              <div class="clearfix">
                <div class="img-container">
                  <img src="../img/05_gamcheon1.JPG" alt="gamcheon1" style="width:100%">

              </div>
              <li><b>Haedong Yeonggung Temple:</b> A really nice temple by the sea. I’m not normally a huge temple nerd like Warren is, but I really liked this temple. Thankfully, it was off-season so there weren’t as many tourists as there could’ve been. The temple was easily accessible by bus and our Airbnb host left us a nice guide of bus routes to get here. My favorite part of the temple was how aesthetic the layout was and how nice it looked against the sea and blue skies. The most memorable part of this location was watching birds eat the rice offering placed on the shrine.</li>
              <li><b>Daiso:</b> Daiso is a Japanese 100yen store. In Korea, you can find multistory Daisos that sell pretty much everything from clothes to laundry detergent to snacks to kitchen supplies. It’s pretty nuts how much is in there. Of course not everything is 1000won, but the prices are still fairly reasonable and a fun place to kill time. I tend to do this at all Daisos, but try not to buy too many things you don’t need.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Seoul</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/05_kakao1.JPG" alt="Ryan portraits"">
            <p>If you came to shop, Seoul is your place! It boasts long underground subway malls, department stores, shopping streets selling your favorite K-Beauty brands, and street stores selling clothes. There’s no shortage of street food, themed cafes, and trendy food places either. Not sure where all the young people were at, but we mainly saw business-people and elderly people when traveling around. Perhaps we didn’t hit the most hip places.</p>
            <h5>Accomodation</h5>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21843127?source_impression_id=p3_1563320078_eQ8pdHrlAxKRKD5r">first Airbnb</a> we stayed at was a small studio apartment in Jong-Gu. It was in a quiet neighborhood that was close to a convenience store and a few minutes walk from the closest subway station. Right outside of it was a street market selling produce, bentos, and street snacks. The room itself was clean and cutely decorated and had a washing machine. The floors had a function to heat up, which was much appreciated after a day of being outside in the cold. The host, though we never met them, were responsive and gave us recommendations and tips. They even offered to help us order delivery if we chose to stay in.</p>
            <p>I messed up and booked the Airbnb short one day, so we booked a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23790492?source_impression_id=p3_1563320083_FtTH0JYu5f7roqE6">second Airbnb</a> was in Juan in Incheon. My line of thinking was that I would book an Airbnb closer to Incheon International Airport, but alas, this place wasn’t that much closer to the airport than our previous one. No worries though because we had a great stay with our hosts and their poodle, Maru. The room was very clean and our hosts spoke English well. We got to chat with them about America and our travels and plans. I highly recommend their place.</p>
            <h5>Food</h5>
            <p>Eat around university areas for hip, affordable restaurants. Many of them offer dishes that are popular with the young people. There’s also cute cafes and stores around these areas. We didn’t really have specific places to eat. A lot of it was wandering around and looking at the menus through the window and seeing what seemed good.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b><a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264337">Geongbokgung Palace</a>:</b> The largest of the 5 palaces. Admission is only 3000won, but if you rent a Hanbok at one of the surrounding rental stores, you can get in for free. That said, Hanbok rentals go for 10000-20000won depending on where you go. It’s definitely a fun experience though. The store we went to let us pick the top and the skirt. They also did our hair and gave me a small purse while storing the rest of our belongings in a locker. The palace is beautiful and quite big. There are gardens and well-kept buildings. It’s a great place to take pictures in Hanbok. A group of Chinese tourists ran up to us to take pictures with us because we were in those traditional clothes.</li>

                </div>
              </div>
              <li><b>Hongdae:</b> A popular university area! We only stopped by in the evening for dinner, but there were trendy brand stores and plenty of places to eat. The Western-style food places were more expensive than the quieter eatery we stopped by at for tteokbokki and kimbap.</li>
              <li><b>Myeongdong:</b> Packed with tourists but also packed with street food and beauty stores. Innisfree, Nature Republic, Olive Young, you name it. There’s also a bunch of circle lens stores here where you can get a pair of colored contact lens for as cheap as 10000won. You don’t need a checkup, just know your prescription. Many of the makeup and skincare stores have testers for most of the products and you’ll often get free samples with your purchases! If you’re planning to spend a lot, consider tax refunds <a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SHP/SH_ENG_1_1.jsp">tax refunds</a> since it’s a cool perk of being a tourist. We didn’t personally spend so much that this was actually worth doing, but we’re just frugal.</li>
              <li><b>Gangnam Underground SHopping Mall:</b> Ready for cheap clothes? This is your place! The stores here sell cute, trendy apparel and accessories for really good prices. I know Thailand also sells cheap clothing, but I feel like the quality and fashion sense in Korea is better. I bought a pair of cute socks for 1000won, 2 nice tops for 5000won total, and some cute Ghibli earrings for probably around the same. This mall is quite long, but I don’t think you have to walk the whole length of it.</li>
              <li><b>Kakao Talk Store:</b> Korea is literally obsessed with the character Ryan. It’s on the T-money card, phone cases, stationary, etc. Kakao is also the preferred messaging app in Korea, so definitely check out their store for cute Kakao character merch. There’s also a cafe at the top floor selling Ryan themed desserts.</li>
              <li><b>LINE Store:</b> No lie, I went to the LINE Flagship store just to look at BT21 merchandise. LINE is also a popular chatting app with cute characters, but it’s not as widely used as Kakao in Korea. After visiting the LINE pop-up store in Hollywood the prior month, I really wanted to go to one in Korea. I ended up purchasing stickers and a pop-socket like thing with the BT21 character, Mang.

              <li><b><a href="https://dfwm.kr/main/view">Dongdaemun Market:</a></b> We didn’t personally go here, but my uncle who frequently travels to Korea for business says this is also a great shopping places, especially for counterfeit designer products. It looks like it’s pretty huge, so you might want to read up on it before going!</li>

            <h4>Overall</h4>
            <p>Korea is unfamiliar in a different way than Thailand is, but I’m starting to realize that I’ll feel that way when I travel to a new place for the first time, and probably first few times. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this country, and how much I’m looking forward to visiting again. Definitely planning to do more research for next time and <i>learn Hangul.</i></p>
            <p>Aaaaand this concludes our 5 week trip to Asia! I’ve learned a lot from this trip and I’m glad I committed to doing this. Learning to plan and navigate in different cultures and practicing efficient packing are skills I couldn’t have acquired elsewhere. If I could do it again, I would give more time to properly explore each city. Spending 3-5 days per city was definitely not enough time to truly experience the culture. At least for me, I want to go deeper than just the touristy things. That said, I hope these posts have helped you in some way as you plan your trip to any of these destinations. I’m no travel expert, but I’ve done enough of it to offer my advice. Feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions (:</p>
