          <p><i>Part 1 of my 5-Week Asia trip! Check out what I packed <a href="01_packing.html">here</a>. Posts for my <a href="03_taiwan2018.html">Taiwan</a>, <a href="04_japan2018.html">Japan</a>, and <a href="05_korea2018.html">Korea</a> complete this series!</i></p>
          <p>Technically, this is my second time visiting my father’s birth country, but I was really too young to remember anything the first time. One thing I remember is not enjoying Thai-style Pizza Hut. There’s so much about Thai culture that I don’t know (mostly because my dad and grandparents didn’t teach me much), so everything was new and exciting territory to explore.</p>
          <p>That being said, I did a good amount of Google research before going to Thailand. No matter where in the world you’re going, <i>always do your research</i>, whether it be word of mouth or online. It will save you a lot of headache (and money!) in the long run. I’ll be including some of my tips and favorite spots in Bangkok and a few in Phuket.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/02_city.JPG" alt="bangkok">
          <br><br>
          <h5>Weather</h5>
          <p>I traveled in late September to early October, butThailand was still fairly muggy (i.e. hot and humid). There was a good amount of sun as well as rain and thunderstorms. Both my Airbnbs had umbrellas that we could borrow, but they’re cheap enough to buy from a street vendor if you don’t have access to one. Also, if you aren’t familiar with the hot humidity that is Asian summers, be prepared to be sticky and sweaty the moment you step outside an air-conditioned building. Thankfully, the Airbnb in Phuket had communal washing machines that we used to freshen up our clothes before getting on our way to Taiwan.</p>

          <br>

          <h4>Bangkok</h4>
          <p>First impression: what have I gotten myself into?</p>
          <p>Bangkok is bustling and dirtier than any of the countries I’ve visited.I don’t speak Thai, I know very little about Thai culture, and I’m not overly familiar with the cuisine. It’s obvious that Thailand is still very much developing, but I’ve found that it has a lot of good stuff to offer (excluding mosquitos).</p>
          <h5>Transportation</h5>
          <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/02_train.jpg" alt="train">
          <p>I’m so glad I did my research prior to coming. The scammers here are real, not gonna lie. Right in the airport, there were plenty of bus companies offering to take us everywhere, but probably ready to rip you off. These are the transportation methods that I utilized instead:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/"><b>GrabTaxi</b></a>: Recommended by my AirBnB host! It’s an app that works like Uber or Lyft, but in Southeast Asia. GrabTaxi has their own pricing system, so you can’t get scammed by taxi drivers that refuse to turn on the meter, or tuk tuk drivers that are the biggest tourist traps.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/mrt.htm"><b>MRT</b></a>: The subway system that can get you to most of the popular tourist spots and areas. The maps online are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li><b>Buses</b>: I did my best to navigate the bus routes using Google Maps but it still wasn’t the most accurate. However, the bus system is one of the cheapest ways to get around Bangkok (besides walking).</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.bangkok.com/bts/"><b>BTS Skytrain</b></a>: This is the newest railway system. Unlike the MRT, the Skytrain is above ground. There’s a metro card that you can buy and load with money to make getting onto the train quicker.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h5>Tourist-trappy areas are also easy to spot.</h5>
          <p>Khaosan Road and Chatuchak Weekend Market we’re full of locals trying to lure tourists into buying their things or services. They will try using every language they know to get your attention; I’ve been addressed in English, Mandarin, and even Japanese (for the record I’m an Asian American of Taiwanese-Thai heritage). To be fair, these individuals probably rely on tourists for their income, and their prices aren’t ridiculous compared to America.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Fun Places</h5>
          <br>
          <div class="clearfix">
            <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
              <img src="../img/02_chatuchak.JPG" alt="chatuchak" style="width:100%">
              </div>
            <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
              <img src="../img/02_temple.JPG" alt="Wat Arun" style="width:100%">
            </div>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <br>
            <li><b>Chatuchak Weekend Market</b>: You could spend hours in the maze that is this market. I don’t think we even walked all of it. There were plenty of tourists shopping here, and for good reason. This is a great place to get all your souvenirs. As a person who grew up in Southern California, I thought all their prices were extremely inexpensive. Maybe to a local, I was ripped off. But I’m not mad about it. Some items I picked up for myself and friends were: elephant pants and shorts and a coin purse. I also enjoyed a pink dragonfruit smoothie, Thai soup noodles (they probably were <i>not</i> pescatarian friendly oops), and coconut ice cream topped  with sweet corn kernels and palm seeds.</li>
            <li><b>Department Stores</b>: Ahh, huge Asian malls. Department stores are a fun place to escape the tropical humidity and enjoy free AC. There are plenty of luxury stores that I make my wallet cry just from thinking about the prices, but the food courts offer clean, delicious food. Definitely not like the overpriced fast food we get at American malls. A lot of these malls are also quite aesthetic with rooftop gardens and whatnot. It’s a nice place to chill when you need a break from Bangkok’s energy.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.maykaidee.com/cooking-school"><b>May Kaidee Cooking Class</b></a>: A vegetarian cooking class that teaches you how to cook classic Thai dishes in a group setting. One of the best ways to learn about a culture’s food is to learn how it’s made. My partner and I took the express cooking class at the Khaosun Road location. The teacher of the class was fun and entertaining, and it was great to talk with other tourists (who all happened to also live in California!).  At the end of the class, May Kaidee herself came to teach a dance lesson. She’s very lively. Some dishes we made included Tom Yum paste and soup, Massaman curry, pad thai, and mango sticky rice. They have classes in their Chiang Mai location as well, so I highly recommend you look into taking one (:</li>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/02_maykaidee.JPG" alt="May Kai Dee">
            <li><b>Temples</b>: I’ve been told that once you’ve seen one temple in Bangkok, you’ve pretty much seen them all.My partner and I visited Wat Arun to see a giant Buddha statue. I attempted to capture it with a panoramic shot but it was very long. Thai temples are quite colorful, which is different from the more modestly colored Japanese and Taiwanese temples I’ve visited.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h5>Food</h5>
          <p>Do visit street markets as good and cheap food is available at practically every corner. That said, <i>be smart about what you’re buying</i>. If something looks sketchy or like it’s been sitting out too long, pass on it. There is likely another stand selling the same thing, but perhaps with better sanitation. This goes for mom&pop style restaurants as well. Food quality control doesn’t really exist here and I did get food poisoning from a restaurant in Phuket. Some favorites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Wang Lang Market</b> One of the many street markets throughout the city. I noticed a lot more locals here, which meant little to no people trying to hustle you into buying products like in Chatuchak, where it’s geared for tourists. I especially enjoyed the Kanomtago, which was a coconut pudding in a banana leaf cup. They are topped with a variety of colorful toppings like tapioca, sweet potato, beans, corn, etc.</li>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../img/02_wanglang.JPG" alt="tapioca" style="width:100%">
              </div>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../img/02_crepes.JPG" alt="crepes" style="width:100%">
              </div>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../img/02_cocoicecream.JPG" alt="cocoicecream" style="width:100%">
              </div>
            </div>
            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChanYupa.Tearoom/"><b>Chan & Yupa Tea Room</b></a>: A beautiful and affordable afternoon tea spot! The interior is cutely decorated and the tea and snacks were elegant. Shoutout to my coworker for recommending this place! My only regret was that I was a sweaty mess and certainly not dressed as prettily as the decor.</li>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_chanyupa2.JPG" alt="Chan & Yupa" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_chanyupa1.JPG" alt="Chan & Yupa" style="width:100%">
              </div>
            </div>
          </ul>
          <p>An interesting aspect that I noticed is that Thai culture isn’t really big on tea regular. We saw plenty of coffee and Thai tea stands, though. It might be because of the weather, to which I wouldn’t blame them.</p>
          <p>I would also like to express how much of a rip-off food at the Suvarnabhumi Airport is.</p>

          <h5>Buying Cheap Stuff</h5>
          <p>Honestly, even rip-off prices for elephant pants here are cheaper than what I can find in America. If you feel like a price point is too steep, you can try to haggle. If that’s too much trouble, I’d say hold off and walk around. Chances are, there’s another stand selling the exact same thing for a cheaper price. Returns don’t exist here so don’t let clever salespeople take advantage of tourist ignorance.</p>

          <br>

          <h4>Phuket</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/02_fishfeet.JPG" alt="fish feet">
          <p>A Thai Hawaii -- or so I’ve been told. Having visited Hawaii this year, I can say that Phuket is nothing like it. Sure there are beaches, but I personally didn’t find this island particularly beautiful or compelling. Maybe it used to be, but honestly, Phuket felt like one huge tourist trap. There were so many Chinese tourists here and I was often addressed in Mandarin. That said, if you’re a fan of Asian tour buses and don’t really care for the stress(strike) fun of planning, you might have a better time here on those.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Accommodation + Transportation</h5>
          <p>The easiest way from mainland Thailand to Phuket is through plane. We flew VietJet for about $18. The cheapest way to get from the airport and into Phuket is through the Aiport Bus (http://www.airportbusphuket.com/). Don’t let scammy buses, tuk tuk drivers, and taxis take your hard earned cash!</p>
          <p>I booked an Airbnb that turned out to be a small hotel. They room was clean, had AC, and basic toiletries. I was a little careless and didn’t realize how far it was from the airport, though. Phuket doesn’t have as many convenient transportation options like Bangkok, especially if you stay outside the main touristy areas (whoops). You’ll realistically be relying on taxis, which try extra hard to rip you off here.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Fun Stuff</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Patong Beach</b>: One of the most popular beaches on the island. The beach was alright. Keep in mind that I went to school in San Diego, where we have pretty sweet beaches. I wouldn’t say to skip Patong Beachas it’s worth the trip since you’re in Phuket.</li>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_patong1.JPG" alt="patong1" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_patong2.JPG" alt="patong2" style="width:100%">
              </div>
            </div>
            <li><a href="https://www.kimsmassagespa.com/"><b>Kim’s Massages</b></a>: Who can say no to 10 dollars for an hour-long, full body massage session? Not my partner and not even me, who normally doesn’t buy into “spa” services. It was cheap, had good reviews, and wasn’t a tourist trap. The masseuses were efficient and they pull you in some interesting positions that align with Thai massages. Overall, I’d probably do it again.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.phuket.com/shopping/banzaan-market.htm"><b>Banzaan Market</b></a>: Basically a seafood market where you haggle for fresh fish downstairs, and bring it to one of the cooks upstairs to prepare in a way of your choosing. Very overrun with Chinese tourists and the price isn’t the cheapest you can find in Thailand. However, the food was fresh, delicious, and filling!</li>
            <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZajCHdcQCGwDikgD6"><b>สเต็ก๖๖๖ ภูเก็ต</b></a>: A cute, Western style family-run restaurant that was near out Airbnb. My partner and I ate here two nights in a row because we loved the food. The menu includes Thai and Western food. Also, their roti with condensed milk was absolutely delicious.</li>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_patongfood.JPG" alt="patongfood" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              <div class="img-container" style="width:50%">
                <img src="../img/02_roti.JPG" alt="roti" style="width:100%">
                <br>
                <center><blockquote class="blockquote"><a href="02_thailand2018.html">Back to Top &#8634</a></blockquote></center>
              </div>
            </div>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <h4>Overall</h4>
          <p>All in all, I’d go back to Bangkok again. Now that I’m more mentally prepared for the onslaught of locals trying to sell you things left and right, I’d love to explore the city more. Because the environment and culture were not ones that I’m familiar navigating, I did run into problems occasionally. That said, I still think Thailand is a great country with a lot of culture and definitely worth visiting!</p>
